## About this fork

PS5_RPCS3 is my fork of [RPCS3](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3) for my modded
PlayStation 5 homebrew stack. RPCS3 is the project; its developers get the credit
for the emulator. This fork only adds what the console needs to run it as a native
homebrew title: a frontend without Qt, the console's memory, JIT and thread rules
through my platform layer, the display, pad and audio. The changes are behind
`__PROSPERO__` or in files of their own, so upstream merges stay clean.

- **The title** that builds it is [PS5_RPCS3Title](https://github.com/KongaTime/PS5_RPCS3Title)
  (`PPSA99200`), made from PS5_VulkanTemplate. It pins this fork by revision.
- **Keeping in step**: `main` is the only branch. I merge `upstream/master` into it
  regularly and never rebase or force-push.
- **Licence**: RPCS3 is GPL-2.0-only. The PS5 platform layer it links is
  GPL-3.0-or-later, and the two cannot be combined in one distributed program. So
  there are no binaries of this port: build it from source for your own console,
  and don't share the builds.
- **No piracy**: no games, firmware or keys are or will be provided. Install the
  PS3 system software from Sony's own update file, and use dumps of games you own.

### AI Use

Use of AI tools for research and reverse engineering purposes is permitted. However, contributors are expected to fully own and understand all code they submit. Any communication with the team — including code, code comments, and GitHub comments — must come from the human contributor, not an AI agent acting autonomously.

We have unfortunately seen a rise in untested and unverified AI-generated slop being submitted to this project. This wastes maintainer time and, in worse cases, such changes get merged and break functionality for all users. Repeated violations will result in a ban from the repository. Please be respectful of everyone's time.

**Pull requests opened by AI agents or automated tools must include a disclosure in the PR description** stating the scope of AI involvement — which parts were AI-generated and what human testing or review was performed prior to submission. PRs that omit this disclosure may be closed without review.

If you are unsure about your work, open a discussion issue to talk it through with the team, or reach out to a maintainer on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RPCS3).
